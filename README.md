# Voice Synthesis with DiffSVC

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the training of a personalized voice model using Diff-SVC. The model was trained on hours of my freestyle rap recordings, carefully processed and prepared for optimal training.

## Project Overview
Data Collection: I meticulously collected hours of my freestyle rap performances, ensuring a diverse and representative dataset.
Data Processing: The raw audio data was processed using various tools to enhance quality, normalize volume levels, and segment it into suitable training samples.
Model Training: The processed data was fed into the Diff-SVC architecture for training. Diff-SVC's innovative approach to voice modeling allowed for efficient and accurate learning of my unique vocal characteristics.
Creative Application: The trained model is used to recreate famous songs in my own voice, showcasing the potential of Diff-SVC for creative expression and voice synthesis.

## Diff-SVC Architecture Highlights
Diffusion Models: Diff-SVC leverages diffusion models for high-quality audio generation and natural-sounding speech synthesis.
Conditional Generation: The model is conditioned on text input, allowing for precise control over the generated audio's content and style.
Versatility: Diff-SVC can be adapted to various voice cloning and synthesis tasks, making it a powerful tool for creative applications.

## Notebook Contents
